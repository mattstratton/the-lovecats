## FAQs

*What should I wear?*<br>
We're having a casual backyard wedding. Dress comfortably and wear shoes that are good for walking on grass. Consider casual cocktail attire, but we want you to be comfortable. If you want to wear a suit or a dress, go for it! If you want to wear shorts and a t-shirt, that's fine too. Just be comfortable and fun!

*What if it rains?*<br>
We have a tent reserved in case of rain, so the wedding will go on rain or shine! Bring an umbrella if it's raining though.

*Are kids invited?*<br>
Yes! We love kids and would be thrilled to have them at our wedding.

*Do you have a registry?*<br>
No, we're old and have lots of stuff. But if you'd like to give a gift, we have a [Riot Fest](https://riotfest.org/) tickets or tattoo fund.

*Where should I park?*<br>
There should be plenty of street parking available on Prince Court and the surrounding streets. Please be respectful of our neighbors and do not block driveways.

*When does it start?*<br>
We will be starting at 5PM! Unless you're part of the Getting Ready Crew, please try to arrive as close to cocktail hour at 5 PM as possible.

*What about toasts at dinner?*<br>
While we’re not doing any formal or scheduled toasts during dinner, if you feel moved to get up and share a memory or say a few words, we’d love that. Totally optional and nothing needs to be prepared, we just wanted to let you know in case you want to think about it ahead of time.

*Will the dogs be there?*<br>
While Moxie and Cody are important members of our family, they will not be at the wedding. We will have a photo of them on display.

*I’m staying in downtown Chicago. How can I get to your house?*<br>
If you don't have a car, Uber or Lyft are your best bet. It's about a 45 minute drive from downtown. If you're taking public transportation, you can take the [BNSF Metra](https://ridertools.metrarail.com/maps-schedules/train-lines/BNSF) from Union Station to the Lisle station and then Uber or Lyft from there.

*How do I RSVP?*<br>
Please visit [this link](/rsvp) to RSVP.

*How late does it go?*<br>
No idea! But probably pretty late :)
